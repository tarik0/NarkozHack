# Time Flies
Me and my homies used to use this script to gun down our enemies at our favorite Gmod DarkRP server.
There were in-game case system like CsGo and they were pretty expensive, I used to buy plenty of them and there were a bug-bounty program that gives you free expensive cases. I used my precious time and money to get those cases. I knew it was all meaningless but at the end I saw the attention that the server players gave me and I think It felt good so I kept playing. It's like the time that we all started coding and became script-kiddies, all of that to get respected...

And since our favorite server is going to close down I just felt like finding this and publishing.

Even through were all toxic teenagers and sweared to our moms like a child I have no regrets. I've gained good friends in that server.
Goodbye bois, It was stupid but It was also fun...
